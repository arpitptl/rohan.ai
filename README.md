# FIP AI Monitor

## Executive Summary
FIP AI Monitor is an intelligent system designed to predict and optimize Financial Information Provider (FIP) performance in the Account Aggregator ecosystem. The system leverages advanced machine learning techniques to forecast downtime, optimize traffic routing, and provide proactive alerts, ultimately reducing failed transactions by 40% and enhancing operational efficiency.

### Value Proposition
- Reduce failed transactions by 40%
- Improve end-user experience through intelligent routing
- Enable data-driven operational decisions
- Provide 15-60 minutes advance warning of potential issues

## Problem Statement

Financial Information Providers (FIPs) in the Account Aggregator ecosystem face several critical challenges:

### Current Pain Points
- **Reactive Monitoring**: Issues are only detected after they occur
- **Unpredictable Downtime**: No advance warning system for FIP issues
- **Poor User Experience**: Failed transactions due to unhealthy FIP routing
- **Operational Overhead**: Heavy reliance on manual monitoring
- **Resource Wastage**: Inefficient traffic distribution

### Business Impact
- Transaction failure rates ranging from 0% to 70%
- Increased customer support escalations during FIP downtime
- Revenue loss from failed financial data requests
- High manual intervention requirements for traffic management

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Predictive Downtime Engine**
   - Time series forecasting for success rate trends
   - Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
   - Maintenance window pattern recognition
   - Real-time data ingestion from Prometheus
   - Multiple ML models (LSTM, Prophet, Isolation Forest)

2. **Intelligent Health Scoring**
   - Multi-metric health calculation
   - Trend analysis and momentum indicators
   - Comparative FIP scoring
   - Historical trend visualization

3. **Smart Alerting System**
   - Predictive alerts (30-minute advance warning)
   - Pattern-based alerts
   - Critical incident notifications
   - Maintenance window predictions

4. **AI-Powered Dashboard**
   - Real-time performance monitoring
   - Predictive insights visualization
   - Historical trend analysis
   - Custom alert management

## Success Metrics

- **Prediction Accuracy**: 75%+ for downtime prediction
- **Alert Lead Time**: 15-30 minutes before performance degradation
- **Transaction Success**: 15% increase in AA gateway success rate
- **Operational Efficiency**: 60% reduction in manual monitoring
